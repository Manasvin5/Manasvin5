## I Use ARCH btw!

I'm **Manasvin Shrimali**, a tech-hobbyist from city of lakes, *Udaipur*, India. 
Just a uni student pretending to understand and learn computer science. *ARCH* enthusiast, Emacs devotee(Follower of **Church** of Emacs){I secretly use Code-OSS}, Mac and Windows hater ,and Hyprland power user. 
I hate trendy things. I'm just a little bit overweight and haven't touched grass in like three years. Mildly conservative leftist.
Here's a little more about me:

#### 🔍 Areas of Interest
- **Programming Languages:** While I know a bit of **Python**, I'm currently trying to learn The **C** Programming Language. The thrill of understanding low-level programming and system internals keeps me motivated.
- **Operating Systems:** I'm an hardcore Linux user(but..), constantly exploring its various distros and functionalities.
  AUR is the best.. and I use the blackarch repo too. I have once also sucessfully installed GENTOO 😅😅. Once I built LFS(Linux-For-Scratch) from a user-script 
- **Low-Level Hardware:** Understanding how things work at a fundamental level and interacting with hardware directly is something I find incredibly exciting.
- **Linux on Unusual Devices:** There's something uniquely satisfying about running Linux on devices it's not typically meant for. This interest drives me to experiment and push boundaries.
- **Hacking:** I have the technical know-how of the Comptia Linux+ and CEH(Certified Ethical Hacker) Certs.
- **GNU and Richard Stallman:** I have immense respect for GNU and consider **Richard Stallman** to be my **Guruji**. His philosophy and
  contributions to the free software movement i am a fan of them.
- **Bash Scripting:** Automating tasks and creating simple programs using Bash is joy. I steal other people bash scripts too.
- **Window Managers:** I'm a big fan of tiling window managers like DWM. They provide a customizable and efficient workspace, aligning perfectly with my unproductive needs.
  I enjoy tinkering and learning about the inner workings of system.
